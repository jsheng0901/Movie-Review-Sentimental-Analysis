The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, 
This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. 
You are asked to label phrases on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive. 
Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.

In this project some of the text data is ambiguous. I try to clean the text data before applying different NLP models.
